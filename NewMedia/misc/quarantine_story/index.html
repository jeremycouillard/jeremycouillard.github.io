    <h1>My Quarantine Story So Far</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>I had an art show in Times Square that closed early. When we went to deinstall the city was in its early stages of emptying out. This was the last time I took the subway.</p>
    <img src="img/03.jpg">
    <img src="img/04.jpg">
    <p>I started going to work in pajama pants. But sometimes for meetings I wear a collared shirt. My dinner table is now my work desk</p>
    <img src="img/05.jpg">
    <p>Almost all the subways are down. The only other time I remember that was during the strike.</p>

    <p>It's both nice and anxiety inducing to see a once congested neighborhood be so quiet and calm. I hear birds everywhere now. Almost everything in the neighborhood is closed. Some fruit stands stayed open, though, and they don't have long lines.</p>
    <img src="img/13.jpg">
    <p>We see a lot more animals out on our walks.</p>
    <img src="img/12.jpg">
    <p>A lot of days after working I take a walk up to the airport. The totally empty runway at one of the most crowded airports in the country contextualizes the seriousness of this situation. It seems like the city I once knew will never quite be the same again.</p>
